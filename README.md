# Data Science For Supply Chain Forecast Book

## About the book
Data Science for Supply Chain Forecasting by Nicolas Vandeput is a book that focuses on the application of data science techniques to improve forecasting in supply chain management. It covers various forecasting methods, from traditional statistical approaches to more advanced machine learning techniques. 

## About the repository
This repository is where I upload my Python practices with techniques mentioned the book, including:
- Forecasting KPIs: Bias, Error, MAD, MAE, MAPE, MSE and RMSE
- Statistical methods: Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing, Double Exponential Smoothing With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Multiplicative) With Damped Trend, Triple Exponential Smoothing (Additive) With Damped Trend
- Outlier cleaning
- Statistical models optimization for Simple and Double Exponential Smoothing models
- Machine Learning methods: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, AdaBoost, XGBoost, K-means Clustering, Parameter Optimization with K-Fold Cross-Validation and RandomSearch, etc.
